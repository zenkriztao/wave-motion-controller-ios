# Wave Motion Controller iOS

## Overview

**Wave Motion Controller iOS** is a robust framework designed to bring fluid, wave-like animations and motion effects to iOS applications. Whether youâ€™re building visually captivating user interfaces, creating dynamic transitions, or implementing complex animation systems, this library empowers you to control and manipulate wave dynamics easily.

This tool provides developers with the ability to create smooth, organic motion effects, making it ideal for applications requiring immersive and interactive experiences. By adjusting parameters like wave amplitude, frequency, and speed, developers can craft custom wave behaviors that adapt to their app's needs.

## Features

- ðŸŒŠ **Fluid Wave Animation**: Create realistic and smooth wave movements with ease.
- ðŸ”„ **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the amplitude, frequency, and speed of the waves for full control.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Interactive Design**: Incorporate user-driven wave dynamics that react to gestures, touch, or other interactive events.
- ðŸŒŸ **Seamless Transitions**: Implement smooth transitions that mimic natural wave behavior, ideal for UI/UX transitions or dynamic elements.
- ðŸ’¡ **Flexible & Scalable**: Easily integrate the library into existing projects or use it as the foundation for more complex animation systems.
- ðŸ§  **Optimized for Performance**: Engineered for high performance, ensuring smooth animations even in resource-intensive scenarios.

## Installation

To integrate **Wave Motion Controller iOS** into your project, follow these simple installation steps:

### CocoaPods (recommended)
Add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'WaveMotionController', '~> 1.0'
````

Then run the following command to install the pod:

```bash
pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

Alternatively, you can use Swift Package Manager. Add the following package dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/wave-motion-controller-ios.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to get started with the **Wave Motion Controller iOS** in your app:

### Basic Setup

```swift
import WaveMotionController

let waveController = WaveMotionController()

waveController.setAmplitude(10)
waveController.setFrequency(2)
waveController.setSpeed(1.5)

waveController.startWaveAnimation()
```

### Interactive Example

You can also bind wave properties to user interactions like touch or gesture events:

```swift
@objc func handlePanGesture(_ gesture: UIPanGestureRecognizer) {
    let translation = gesture.translation(in: view)
    let waveAmplitude = translation.x / 10
    waveController.setAmplitude(waveAmplitude)
}
```

### Custom Wave Parameters

```swift
waveController.setAmplitude(15)
waveController.setFrequency(5)
waveController.setSpeed(3)
waveController.startWaveAnimation()
```

## Advanced Features

* **Wave Control**: Dynamically adjust wave properties at runtime, such as the amplitude, frequency, and speed based on user interactions or time-based events.
* **Multiple Wave Layers**: Combine multiple wave layers to create complex, layered animations and effects that blend seamlessly with your appâ€™s design.
* **Performance Optimization**: Built with efficiency in mind, this library is optimized for real-time rendering, ensuring smooth animations without compromising performance.
